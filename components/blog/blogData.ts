Vibe coding is about moving as fast as you can think. But not all AI builders are created equal. When comparing **Greta** and **Lovable**, the difference lies in the transition from prototype to production.

### 1. Architecture: Production vs. Prototype
While Lovable is exceptional for rapid UI mockups and "vibe" sharing, Greta is built for **founding engineers** who need to maintain code integrity. Greta generates code that follows industry best practices (MERN, SQL, etc.), whereas prototype speed can sometimes lead to technical debt in other tools.

### 2. Growth Engineering Focus
Greta isn't just about code; it's about the entire lifecycle. With built-in modules for SEO, analytics, and conversion tracking, your app is engineered for growth from the first prompt. This is why Questera users move faster—not just in building, but in scaling.`,

Bolt.new relies on WebContainer technology. It is a masterpiece of engineering for running Node.js in the browser, but production apps live in the cloud, not the chrome tab. **Greta** provides the bridge between the prompt and professional infrastructure.

### Why Greta Wins on Infra
1. **Native Deployment:** Unlike browser-bound environments, Greta hooks directly into your hosting providers (Vercel, Netlify, GCP).
2. **Deep DB Integration:** Greta understands Supabase and MongoDB at a schema level, not just as an API endpoint.
3. **Scalability:** When your traffic grows, a Greta-built app is already structured to handle the load.`,

Replit changed the world with their cloud-based IDE, and their Agent is a powerful tool for rapid prototyping. However, when we talk about **Vibe Coding** for production, Greta takes a fundamentally different approach.

### 1. Developer Control & Portability
Replit aims to keep you in their ecosystem. Greta is built on the philosophy of **Portability**. Your code, your GitHub, your choice of infra. Greta builds your app to live anywhere, giving you the freedom that founding engineers demand.

### 2. Built-in Growth Engineering
While Replit is a general-purpose IDE, Greta (Growth Engineering Tech Agent) is specialized. We don't just build the code; we build the marketing hooks, the SEO paths, and the conversion funnels. Greta understands that a startup needs more than just a running script—it needs a product that scales and sells.

### 3. State Management & Complexity
For complex full-stack apps, Greta's Agent Mode excels at maintaining context across deep directory structures. Whether it's complex Redux logic or Supabase RLS policies, Greta is engineered for the "hard stuff" of production software.`,

v0.dev has changed how we think about UI, but Greta changes how we think about apps. While v0 gives you the component, Greta gives you the **action**.

### The Greta Advantage
Greta handles state management, API integrations, and backend logic that static UI generators simply can't touch. We aren't just building a "look"; we're building a system.`,

When it comes to building and deploying apps at the speed of thought, **Greta** and **Rocket.new** are two of the most discussed tools in the ecosystem. While Rocket.new offers a sleek, opinionated path to launching browser-based projects, Greta (Growth Engineering Tech Agent) is designed for the long game: **production agility and growth.**

### 1. Architectural Integrity vs. Instant Deployment
Rocket.new is fantastic for projects that need to be live "yesterday." It's optimized for the fastest possible deployment from a prompt. However, Greta is built for **Founding Engineers**. Greta generates clean, modular code following MERN or SQL best practices that you can actually maintain, scale, and audit.

### 2. Built-in Growth Engineering
Rocket focuses on the *launch*. Greta focuses on the *growth*. Every app built with Greta comes with optional, intelligent modules for:
- **SEO Optimization:** Headings, metadata, and sitemaps are first-class citizens.
- **Analytics Integration:** Ready-to-go hooks for tracking user behavior.
- **Conversion Loops:** Built-in logic for customer acquisition.

### 3. Logic Complexity
While Rocket.new excels at standardized web patterns, Greta shines in **complex state management** and **multi-step backend logic**. Whether you are coordinating complex Supabase RLS policies or building custom Redux flows, Greta's Agent Mode understands the depth of production-grade software architecture.

### 4. Ownership and Portability
Rocket.new often keeps you within its optimized hosting and environment. Greta is built on the philosophy of **Portability**. Your code lives in your GitHub and deploys to your chosen infrastructure (Vercel, AWS, GCP, etc.), ensuring no vendor lock-in as your startup grows.

### Conclusion: Why Choose Greta?
If you want to build a quick prototype for a hackathon, Rocket.new is great. But if you are building an **AI-first startup** that needs to scale, convert, and evolve, Greta is the growth engine you need.`,
